# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Web App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple, clean movie web app I built using **React**. It shows trending movies, lets you search for any title, and gives you all the juicy details (like ratings, overviews, and posters). Powered by the **TMDb API**.

I built this as part of my summer bootcamp â€” learned a ton and had a blast doing it!

## ðŸ’¡ What It Can Do

- ðŸ”¥ Shows trending movies on the homepage
- ðŸ”Ž Real-time search feature (with a little debounce magic)
- ðŸŽ¬ Click any movie to view more details in a modal
- âš¡ Fast, responsive, and built with hooks
- ðŸ§  Counts searches (using Appwrite â€“ optional)

## ðŸ›  Tech I Used

- **React**
- **TMDb API**
- **Appwrite** (for search count tracking)
- **CSS** (or Tailwind if you're using it)
- Maybe **Vite** for faster dev (if you're fancy ðŸ˜Œ)
